# backend.jl -- one verb for "run this app", whatever the target.
#
# The Driver seam already makes targets swappable; what it does not do is
# make them swappable WITHOUT EDITING THE CALL. Compare what a user wrote
# before this file existed:
#
#     run!(App(gallery(), TerminalDriver()))            # terminal
#     server = serve(gallery; port = 8000)              # browser
#     try wait(server) finally stop!(server) end
#
# Six things differ across those two lines: an instance vs a factory, who
# constructs the App, whether the call blocks, where `stylesheet` goes,
# whether a driver type is named at all, and which config struct holds
# `title`. None of that is essential -- it is just two entry points that
# grew separately. `launch` is the one entry point:
#
#     launch(gallery)                                   # terminal
#     launch(gallery; backend = WebBackend(port = 8000))  # browser
#
# A `Backend` is a DESCRIPTION of a target, not the target itself: it is
# inert, comparable and cheap to pass around, and `make_driver` turns it
# into a live `Driver` at `launch` time. That indirection is what lets the
# web backend exist at all -- it needs ONE DRIVER PER BROWSER SESSION, so
# it cannot be handed a single pre-built driver.

"""
A description of where an app should run.

Inert on purpose: a `Backend` names a target and carries its settings, but
holds no live resource. `make_driver` turns it into a `Driver` when
`launch` needs one, which is what lets a backend mint a driver per client
rather than being handed one.

Implement a new backend with two things and nothing else:

    struct MyBackend <: ManyUI.Backend end
    ManyUI.make_driver(::MyBackend) = MyDriver()

If a backend ever needs more than `make_driver` to work with `launch`, the
seam has leaked -- fix the seam, do not widen the backend.

A backend whose target multiplexes -- one app per connection, as the web
does -- instead defines its own [`launch`](@ref) method and never uses
`make_driver`. See `ManyUIWeb.WebBackend`.

$(SIGNATURES)

Run `factory`'s app on `backend`.

`factory` is `() -> Widget`, NOT a built widget and NOT `(driver) -> App`.
That is the whole trick: a terminal needs one app, a browser needs one app
PER CLIENT, and only a factory can serve both. Application code never
names a driver type.

    ui() = Container(Label("hello"))

    launch(ui)                                    # this terminal
    launch(ui; backend = WebBackend(port = 8000)) # a browser
    launch(ui; backend = HeadlessBackend())       # a test

`config` and `stylesheet` mean the same thing on every backend -- they
describe the APP, not the target, so they do not move house when the
backend changes. Target settings (a port, a tty) live on the backend.

With `wait = true` (the default) this blocks until the app quits and
returns its exit code, like [`run!`](@ref). With `wait = false` it returns
a handle and leaves the app running. The handle's TYPE is the backend's
business -- an `App` here, a `WebServer` for the web -- but every handle
answers the same three verbs:

    h = launch(ui; wait = false)
    isopen(h)      # still going?
    close(h)       # ask it to stop
    wait(h)        # block until it has

Returns `Int` when `wait = true`.

Start `app`'s loop and return `app` only once the loop is actually up.
Internal.

`start!` merely SPAWNS `run!`, and `run!` is what sets `app.running` --
so returning straight from `start!` hands back a handle that is
constructed but not live: `isopen` says false, and a `close` posted in the
next line races the loop into existence. `serve` has no such gap, it binds
its port before returning, and `launch` promises the same of every backend.

A loop that dies on the way up is rethrown HERE, at the launch site,
rather than left to surface later out of a task nobody is waiting on.

There is no third outcome to wait for: either `run!` reaches
`app.running = true`, or its task finishes. Both are covered, so this
cannot spin forever without a deadline.
