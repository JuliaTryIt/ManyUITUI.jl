# widgets/form.jl -- layer 7, LAST.
# May reference: widget, reactive, paint, buffer, layout, unicode, and
# every field-type file above it -- it names TextInput, TextArea,
# Checkbox, RadioGroup, DropDown and Tabs to give each a `form_value`.
#
# THE HONEST SCOPE, up front: a Form is a Container that can be submitted
# and read. It adds `submit!`, the `form_value` protocol and
# `form_values`, and NOTHING ELSE -- no `on_event!`, no focus concept, no
# validation DSL. TAB traversal is `focusable_widgets`', which already
# works through a bare Container; a Form that "added" it would only add a
# docstring, and a Form that TRAPPED it would be a bug.

"""
THE value protocol: what `w` MEANS to a form. Add ONE method to make a
widget a form field.

THROWS `MethodError` BY DEFAULT ON PURPOSE, and does NOT return
`nothing`: a `Label` has no value, and a form that silently reports
`nothing` for a field the author expected to read is a form that SAVES A
BLANK. A `MethodError` names the type.

`form_value` and not `value`: `value` is far too generic a name for a UI
package to export, and `form_values` below would then read as its
plural. `grid_of` (tablecore.jl) is the precedent -- a seam is a
FUNCTION, not a supertype, which is what lets six unrelated widget types
share it.

THE METHODS LIVE HERE, NOT IN EACH WIDGET'S FILE, and the layering and
the manifest agree for once: "what this widget means to a form" is the
FORM'S concept, not the text field's.

"""
A `Container` that can be submitted and read.

WHAT THIS ADDS OVER A `Container`, EXHAUSTIVELY, BECAUSE THE HONEST
ANSWER IS "NOT MUCH":

  1. `submit!(f)` -- `on_validate(f)` and, iff it returns true,
     `on_submit(f)`.
  2. `form_value(w)` -- a PROTOCOL, and the only reusable thing here.
  3. `form_values(f)` -- every named field's value, once, at the
     boundary.

WHAT IT DOES NOT ADD, and the claims are worth refuting because every
framework makes them:

  * "It groups fields."   -- so does a `Container`. It IS one, and it
    defines no `render!` and no `measure` for `Container`'s reason.
  * "It traverses focus." -- `focusable_widgets` is a pre-order
    `walk_visible`. TAB ALREADY WORKS through a bare `Container`. This is
    not a feature, it is the core.
  * "ENTER submits."      -- IT DOES NOT, AND IT CANNOT. `TextInput`
    consumes ENTER unconditionally and `_walk!` STOPS DEAD on a consume,
    so a bubble handler here is NEVER REACHED from a text field.
    Capture-phase would fire and silently kill `TextInput.on_submit`,
    which is shipped and tested. So this widget DEFINES NO `on_event!` AT
    ALL, and you wire `TextInput("", _ -> submit!(f))` -- one closure,
    explicit, and exactly as many characters as the magic would have
    been. A testitem PINS this limitation, so it is a fact and not a
    comment somebody deletes.

Validation is ONE PREDICATE AND A VETO. No rule objects, no error
vector, no `:invalid` class, no DSL. Validation is a function you already
know how to write; a Form that ships a validation framework ships a DSL,
and this codebase has no DSL.

IF THAT LIST DOES NOT EARN A FILE FOR YOU, USE A `Container`. A `Form` IS
one, and nothing built on a `Form` is out of a `Container`'s reach. It
earns its forty lines because `form_value` is worth a protocol and
because "wire ENTER through the field that consumes it" is the thing
every app gets wrong once.

The Form exists BEFORE its fields, so the closure has something to
capture:

    f = Form(save_it)
    add_field!(f, :name, TextInput("", _ -> submit!(f)))
    add_field!(f, :remember, Checkbox("Remember me"))
    mount!(f, Button("Save", _ -> submit!(f)))

No chicken-and-egg, no registry, no `Ref`.

Mount `w` as a field NAMED `name` and return `f`.
