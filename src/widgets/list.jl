"""
A scrollable, focusable list of items.

Scrolls by INDEXING `items`, never by shifting an origin: `render!`
touches `scroll.y + 1 : scroll.y + height` and nothing else, so paint is
O(viewport) and a 100 000-item list costs the same frame as a 10-item
one.

A ROW IS NOT A WIDGET. `TextArea`'s argument (textarea.jl:6), one type
up: a `Scrollpane` inside would mean one widget per ROW, so 100 000
items become 100 000 `WidgetNode`s, a full layout pass per `push_item!`
and 100 000 `render!` dispatches per frame -- and, the part that is easy
to miss, 100 000 hit-test nodes, so `hit_test` would be O(n) on every
POINTER MOVE. 100 000 rows are 100 000 elements of a `Vector` and ZERO
`WidgetNode`s.

PARAMETRIC ON BOTH the element type and the formatter, the
`Button{F}`/`TextInput{F}`/`TextArea{F}` pattern the codebase already
uses three times: `items[i]` is a TYPED load and `w.format(item)` is a
STATIC dispatch. `List{String,typeof(_tc_show)}` formats for ZERO
allocation per row, because `_tc_show(::String)` returns its argument
(`string(s::String) === s`).

THIS is why a `List` is not a one-column `Table`, and it is not
cosmetic: see `Table` for why a table's cell callback is on the widget.
Compare `Label` vs `Static` (label.jl:98) -- two types because one of
them must not pay the other's cost.

`items` is a PLAIN field, deliberately NOT a `Reactive`: `Reactive`'s
`==` guard would be an O(n) elementwise compare on every change AND an
in-place edit would never trip it. `version` is the reactive cell
instead -- an `Int` compare is O(1) for the O(1) edit that happened.
THE PRICE, stated so nobody discovers it: `items` mutated behind
`version`'s back will not repaint -- call `refresh_rows!`. It will NOT
CORRUPT, because `render!` re-syncs the selection's row count every
frame (`_tc_sync!`, O(1) when unchanged).

`items` is ALIASED, never copied: copying 100 000 rows is exactly the
O(n) this widget exists to avoid.

`version` is `Dirty.PAINT`-reactive, and this DIVERGES from
`TextArea.version` (LAYOUT) ON PURPOSE. `TextInput` states the criterion
verbatim (textinput.jl:158): "`Reactive`'s default is the conservative
`Dirty.LAYOUT` precisely because choosing PAINT for state that can
change size is a correctness bug. The text-independent `measure` above
is what licenses PAINT here; do not copy the choice to a widget without
that property." `measure(::Any, avail) = avail` HAS that property, and
`compute_layout` NEVER calls `content_extent`. A data change therefore
PROVABLY cannot move a box, so `push_item!` on a 100 000-item list costs
ZERO layout and never fires `escalate_auto!`. `TextArea`'s LAYOUT is
conservative, not normative.

`format(item)` MUST return an `AbstractString` and MUST NOT contain a
newline -- a list row is ONE row. Same contract as `TextArea.lines`, and
policed the same way: not at all.

A list over `items`, calling `on_activate(list)` on ENTER.

`on_activate` is the SECOND POSITIONAL and it is NOT `on_change`:
`List(files, f -> open(f))` with an `on_change` there would fire on
every arrow key, which is a trap the shape of the call invites. There is
ONE callback and it means what it says.

Focusable by construction, so it appears in `focusable_widgets` and is
reachable by TAB with no further wiring.

`items` is ALIASED, not copied. `List(1:100_000)` collects, once, and
the caller knows what they paid.

`widest` starts at ZERO and the formatter is called NOT ONCE here: the
mark is DEFERRED, not skipped. `scanned` starts false and `_lst_scan!`
pays the O(items) measurement at the first query -- which is the first
time anyone ASKS how wide the content is, and therefore the first time
the answer can matter. A `List(1:100_000)` that nobody scrolls pays for
nothing, and the constructor stays O(1) over an aliased `Vector`.

`w.widest`, MEMOIZED on `scanned`: O(1) and ZERO allocation on a hit,
one O(items) scan on the miss. A `List` has no columns, so there is no
grid to resolve and `_tc_extent_width`'s default would not find one --
this is the `List` half of that per-widget branch.

THE MARK IS MEASURED FROM THE DATA AND NEVER FROM THE PAINT, and that
is not a refinement -- it is the difference between a working axis and a
dead one. A mark raised only by `render!` from what it PAINTS cannot
exceed `scroll.x + width`, because `_tc_paint_slice!` reports a CUT row
as exactly that; and `_tc_scroll_x!` moves through `scroll_to!`, clamped
to `max_scroll.x == widest - width`. The two together are a FIXPOINT:

    widest <= scroll.x + width   AND   scroll.x <= widest - width
    =>  scroll.x <= scroll.x

-- the mark pins at the viewport width, `max_scroll.x` pins at ZERO, and
every cell past the first screenful is unreachable FOREVER. The mark
cannot bootstrap, because scrolling is the only thing that would raise
it and the mark is the only thing that permits scrolling. This is the
anti-pattern the architect's contract names for the GRID at
`_tc_resolve!` -- "a `widths` field that only `render!` writes, so
`max_scroll(t).x == 0` -- 'cannot scroll' when it can -- until the first
frame" -- and it is fatal here rather than merely late, because a
`List`'s extent has no columns to resolve it into shape.

THE ASYMMETRY THAT MATTERS, and the reason `TextArea` never had this
bug: an OVER-estimate is self-correcting (you can always scroll, and
`refresh_extent!` shrinks it), an UNDER-estimate is SELF-LOCKING. This
is why `scanned` means "not an under-estimate" rather than "exact": the
monotone over-report `delete_item!` leaves is safe and stays documented.

KEYED ON THE DATA, NOT ON `version` -- deliberately, and this is where
it departs from `_tc_resolve!`'s `(version, avail)`: `version` bumps on
every ARROW KEY (`_tc_touch!`), so keying on it would rescan 100 000
rows per keystroke. `_lst_widen!` MAINTAINS the mark across `push_item!`
and `insert_item!` instead -- `max` over `items ∪ {x}` IS
`max(mark, width(x))` -- so only the two BULK ops invalidate. Internal.

`Size(widest, length(items))`. OVERRIDES the container default
(scroll.jl:84): a `List`'s content is DATA, not children, so the
bounding box of its (nonexistent) children is not its extent. THIS
OVERRIDE IS THE WHOLE INTEGRATION WITH `Scrollbar` --
`Scrollbar{List{T,F,A}}` works with ZERO new code in `scroll.jl`,
because the scrollable seam is three functions and not a type.

`_tc_header_rows(::Any) == 0`, so the `+ hh` of `_tc_extent`
degenerates and this is `Size(widest, n)` exactly.

O(1) AND ZERO ALLOCATION ON EVERY CALL BUT THE FIRST, which is the bar
that matters: THIS FUNCTION IS ON THE FRAME PATH -- `_sb_metrics`,
`max_scroll`, `scroll_to!` and `Scrollpane.render!` all reach it,
several times per frame (scroll.jl:100,115,413,626). `length` on a
`Vector` is O(1) and `widest` is a MEMOIZED mark. Writing
`maximum(text_width, items)` here -- on every call, unmemoized -- would
make every frame O(rows) and IS FORBIDDEN.

THE FIRST call after a bulk data change pays ONE O(items) scan
(`_lst_scan!`), stated rather than hidden. There is no cheaper honest
answer: the widest of `n` rows is not knowable without looking at `n`
rows, and the alternative -- inferring the mark from what `render!`
painted -- is the fixpoint `_tc_extent_width` documents, which does not
cost O(rows) only because it never works at all.

lowers it. THE SAME NAME, THE SAME CONTRACT and the same return type as
`refresh_extent!(::Any)` (textarea.jl:183) -- one name, one
meaning, four widgets, and no new export.

THE TRADEOFF, stated so nobody discovers it, and it is now the SAME as
`TextArea`'s rather than its mirror image: both start EXACT and drift
TOO WIDE as you delete, and this is the call that makes them exact

thumb, it would be a DEAD AXIS -- see `_tc_extent_width` for the
fixpoint. The VERTICAL axis -- the one a list is actually about -- is
EXACT and free either way, because it is `length(items)`.

THIS IS NO LONGER LOAD-BEARING FOR CORRECTNESS, and that is the point:
`_lst_scan!` reaches the same mark automatically, memoized, at the first
query. What is left here is the one thing a monotone mark cannot do

little small, never a cell you cannot reach.
