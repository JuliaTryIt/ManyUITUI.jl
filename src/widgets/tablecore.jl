# widgets/tablecore.jl -- layer 7.
# May reference: widget, reactive, paint, buffer, layout, unicode.
#
# This file defines `RowsWidget`, `Selection`, `Column` and `TableGrid`,
# which `list.jl`, `table.jl` and `datatable.jl` USE and MUST NOT
# redefine.
#
# A ROW IS NOT A WIDGET. `TextArea`'s argument (textarea.jl:6), one type
# up: `node(w).scroll` shifts a node's CHILDREN, and these widgets'
# content is a `Vector` of DATA, not children -- so 100 000 rows are
# 100 000 elements of a `Vector` and ZERO `WidgetNode`s. Widget-per-row
# would mean a full layout pass per edit, 100 000 `render!` dispatches
# per frame, and -- the part that is easy to miss -- 100 000 hit-test
# nodes, so `hit_test` would be O(n) on every POINTER MOVE.
#
# What it reuses, exactly, and it is `textarea.jl`'s list verbatim:
#   * the same field: `node(w).scroll`, via `set_scroll!`/`scroll_to!`;
#   * the same clamps: `clamp_scroll`, `scroll_into_view` (widget.jl);
#   * the same seam: each widget OVERRIDES `content_extent`, so a
#     `Scrollbar{List{T,F,A}}` reports on it with NO new code in
#     `scroll.jl`. That override is exactly why `Scrollbar` is
#     parametric on its viewport.
#
# `Scrollpane(List(...))` remains legal and scrolls the List's whole box
# -- the two mechanisms compose instead of competing.
#
# `Base.textwidth` appears NOWHERE: it reports 1 for a VS16 emoji
# occupying 2 cells and 6 for a ZWJ family occupying 2. No byte indexes
# user text.

# --- the type lattice -------------------------------------------------

"""
A widget whose content is a sequence of DATA ROWS rather than children.

THE SEAM, and it is functions, not fields -- `scroll.jl`'s own move
("the scrollable seam is three functions, not a type"), one layer up.
Every subtype MUST define, each a one-liner:

    selection_of(w)::Any
    row_count(w)::Int             # SOURCE rows. O(1). FRAME PATH.
    view_count(w)::Int            # rows in view order. O(1).
    view_source(w, k::Int)::Int   # view index -> source index
    view_rank(w, s::Int)::Int     # source index -> view index
    _tc_touch!(w)::Nothing        # bump the PAINT cell
    _tc_header_rows(w)::Int       # pinned chrome rows at the top
    _tc_extent_width(w)::Int      # the extent's WIDTH, read not computed

and MUST carry these DIRECT fields:

    node::WidgetNode
    version::Any        # Dirty.PAINT -- see below
    focused::Any

`version`/`focused` MUST be direct fields of the widget and MUST NOT be
moved into a held struct: `attach_reactives!` walks
`fieldnames(typeof(w))` ONE level and binds only direct `Reactive`
fields (reactive.jl:100). A `Reactive` one level down silently never
gets an owner and never marks anything dirty. THAT FAILURE HAS NO ERROR
MESSAGE.

This is NOT a scrollable supertype and must not become one. The
scrollable seam stays the three functions `scroll.jl:57-66` names --
`content_extent`, `layout_of(w).content`, `scroll_of(w)` -- which is why
`Scrollbar{List{T,F,A}}` needs ZERO new code in `scroll.jl`.
`RowsWidget` is a different axis: it is the seam for SELECTION and
NAVIGATION, which are identical across the three rather than merely
similar.

The seam methods take `::Any` and have NO default, so a subtype
that forgets one gets a MethodError -- and a `Button` never answers them
at all.
"""
abstract type RowsWidget <: Widget end

# --- Selection --------------------------------------------------------

"""
A row cursor and a set of selected rows, over `n` SOURCE rows.

NORMATIVE: every index here is a SOURCE index -- an index into the
user's `rows`/`items` -- and NEVER a view index. That is what makes a
sort harmless: `sort_by!` permutes the VIEW and this does not move. The
alternative -- view indices -- silently reassigns the selection to
DIFFERENT ROWS the moment the user clicks a header, which is data
corruption with a pretty animation.

PURE: no widget, no layout, no buffer -- four `Int`s and a `BitSet`, so
the whole selection model is one table test. `thumb_span`
(scroll.jl:572) set that bar and this meets it.

`n` IS A FIELD, and that is deliberate: a `Selection` that does not know
how many rows there are makes every mutator take a caller-supplied `n`
you can get wrong -- `set_cursor!(s, 5, 999)` on a 3-row list parks the
cursor out of range, silently. `resize_selection!` is the ONE way `n`
changes.

`cursor`/`anchor` are `0` when there is no row, never `nothing`: `0`
keeps the fields concrete `Int` and every operation total at `n == 0`.

`rows` is a `BitSet` and not a `Set{Int}` or a `Vector{Bool}`. MEASURED,
not assumed: `in` allocates ZERO for BOTH `BitSet` and `Set{Int}`, so
the usual allocation argument for BitSet is WRONG and is not made here.
BitSet wins on the two axes that survive: an empty selection over
100 000 rows costs ~0 (a `Vector{Bool}`/`BitVector` costs 12.5 kB), and
a contiguous `anchor:target` extend is a bitmap range rather than
100 000 hash inserts. All of Base; no dependency.

# --- Column and TableGrid ---------------------------------------------

"""
One column of a `Table`: a caption, a width policy, an alignment.

IMMUTABLE: a column is a SPEC. Changing one is
`grid_of(t).cols[j] = Column(...)` followed by `refresh_columns!(t)`.

`width` is a `Length` -- `cells(12)`, `pct(25)`, `fr(1)`, `AUTO` --
because those are already the framework's four answers to "how wide",
already parsed by the CSS engine and already resolved by
`definite_size`/`_apportion`. Inventing a fifth vocabulary for columns
would be inventing flexbox next to flexbox.

`align` is `Align.T`, REUSED rather than reinvented: `cross_align`
(layout.jl:163) does the placement, START/CENTER/END are
left/centre/right, and `Align.STRETCH` degenerates to START FOR FREE
because `cross_align(n, STRETCH, w)` returns `(0, w)` and a text painter
reads only the offset. There is no `CellAlign` enum because there is
nothing for one to say that `Align` does not.

`min_width`/`max_width` are `Length`s, not `Int`s: a bound the box model
spells as a `Length` must not be downgraded here. AUTO means unbounded
-- `0` low, `typemax(Int)` high.

`sortable` is ignored by `Table`, which never sorts. It is one `Bool`

headers reserve an indicator cell, and which headers a click sorts.

THE `+ header_rows` IS LOAD-BEARING AND IS NOT A ROUNDING ERROR. It is
FORCED, and here is the proof rather than the assertion:
`Scrollbar._sb_metrics` (scroll.jl:624-634) reads
`content_extent(w.viewport)` and `layout_of(w.viewport).content`
DIRECTLY and NEVER calls `max_scroll`. There is therefore NO seam that
can tell a bar the body is `hh` rows shorter than the box, and
OVERRIDING `max_scroll` WOULD NOT WORK. Counting the header restores

    max_scroll.y = extent.height - content.height = (n + hh) - H
    last body row visible  <=>  scroll.y + (H - hh) == n
                           <=>  scroll.y == n + hh - H

-- the SAME number. So `max_scroll`, `clamp_scroll`, `scroll_to!`,
`scroll_into_view` and `thumb_span` are all already right, and
`Scrollbar{Table{R,F,A}}` needs not one line in `scroll.jl`. Drop the
`+ hh` and THE LAST `hh` ROWS OF EVERY TABLE ARE UNREACHABLE.

THE PRICE, stated rather than discovered: `content_extent(t).height` is
a white lie -- `row_count(t)` is the honest accessor and it is public
and exported -- and the thumb over-reports the visible fraction by
`hh/(n + hh)`, ~5% on a 20-row table with a header, decaying to nothing
as the data grows. That is the cost of not inventing a second scrollable
seam for one row.

cut off.

That return value is what `List.render!` raises `widest` from, and it
makes the high-water mark cost the paint loop NOTHING -- no second pass
over the graphemes, no `text_width` on an unbounded string.

A wide cluster STRADDLING THE LEFT EDGE IS DROPPED, NEVER HALVED. This

`write_text!(buf, 1 - off, ...)` (textinput.jl:344); this is the third

"""
Write `text` into the `cw`-cell column whose left edge is FRAME column
`x0`, aligned per `align`, truncated on a GRAPHEME boundary, clipped to
the frame.

`x0` MAY BE `<= 0`: a column scrolled off the left is a negative start,
exactly as `TextInput.render!` hands `write_text!` a negative `1 - off`.
There is no `skip` parameter; the negative `x0` IS the skip.

TRUNCATION, NORMATIVE:
  * `truncate_width(text, cw)` cuts at `cw` on a CLUSTER boundary and
    DROPS a width-2 cluster that would straddle it
    (`truncate_width("世界a", 3) == "世"`). A CLUSTER THEREFORE
    CANNOT STRADDLE A COLUMN EDGE BY CONSTRUCTION and there is no second
    guard to write. A width-2 cluster in an odd-width column leaves a
    one-cell gap, which is the correct rendering of "it does not fit".
  * When it cut (`_tc_truncated`), `TC_ELLIPSIS` is written in the
    column's LAST cell and the text is re-truncated to `cw - 1`.
  * A TRUNCATED CELL IS ALWAYS LEFT-ANCHORED, whatever `align` says.
    `align` applies ONLY when the text fits. A right-aligned truncated
    number ("…234") reads as a DIFFERENT NUMBER, which is worse
    than a visibly clipped one. It also means an `Align.END` cell can
    never paint its text OVER its own marker.
  * DEGENERATE BY CONSTRUCTION, not by special case: a 1-cell column
    holding "世" gets `truncate_width("世", 1) == ""` and then
    the ellipsis alone -- one cell, one legible glyph, nothing halved.

BOTH `render!` AND `_tc_extent` CALL THIS, and that is what makes
`max_scroll(t).x` correct BEFORE the first paint. Reading a `widths`
field that only `render!` writes would make `max_scroll(t).x == 0` --
"cannot scroll" when it can -- until the first frame.

NOT `Pure`, and this says so rather than hiding it: `content_extent` is
documented `Pure` in scroll.jl:83 and this override writes a memo. The
memo is OBSERVATIONALLY pure -- same inputs, same output -- and its key
is `(version, content-box width)`, NEITHER of which is a function of the
scroll offset. That is the same property `content_extent` itself relies
on ("the extent is independent of the current scroll offset and a scroll
can never feed back into the extent"), and it is why the cache is safe.
A future reader who trusts the base docstring will be surprised once;
that is the price of not lying about `max_scroll`.

`paint.jl` guarantees `render!` and `_tc_extent` agree on `avail`: a
widget "gets a frame that is its FULL content box, so `size(buf)` is the
widget's real content box and is INVARIANT UNDER SCROLL"
(buffer.jl:232), so `size(buf)[1] == layout_of(w).content.width` always
and the key never thrashes within a frame.
