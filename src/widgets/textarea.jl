# this file USES and MUST NOT redefine.
#
# A TextArea REUSES the scroll core and contains no Scrollpane. The
# argument, in one sentence: `node(w).scroll` shifts a node's CHILDREN,
# and a TextArea's content is a `Vector{String}`, not children -- a
# Scrollpane inside would mean one widget per line, so a 10 000-line
# document becomes 10 000 WidgetNodes, a full layout pass per edit and
# 10 000 `render!` dispatches per frame.
#
# What it reuses, exactly:
#   * the same field: `node(w).scroll`, via `set_scroll!`/`scroll_to!`;
#   * the same clamps: `clamp_scroll`, `scroll_into_view` (widget.jl);
#   * the same seam: it OVERRIDES `content_extent`, so a
#     `Scrollbar{TextArea}` reports on it with no new code. That
#     override is exactly why `Scrollbar` is parametric on its viewport.
#
# `Scrollpane(TextArea(...))` remains legal and scrolls the TextArea's
# whole box -- the two mechanisms compose instead of competing.

Multi-line text entry.

Scrolls by INDEXING `lines`, never by shifting an origin: `render!`

one.

`lines` is a PLAIN field, deliberately NOT a `Reactive`: `Reactive`'s
`==` guard would be an O(n) elementwise compare of a `Vector{String}` on

the reactive cell instead -- an `Int` compare is O(1) for the O(1) edit
that actually happened. THE PRICE, stated so nobody discovers it:
`lines` mutated behind `version`'s back will not repaint, so every edit
goes through the ops below.
