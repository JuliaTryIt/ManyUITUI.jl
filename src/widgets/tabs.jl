# A CAPTION IS NOT A WIDGET. Captions are `String`s and panels are
# children: an INACTIVE panel is `set_visible!(false)` and that is the
# WHOLE implementation. From that one flag come four properties, none of
# them code in this file -- an invisible panel paints nothing
# (paint.jl:103), claims no layout space (layout.jl:267,377), drops out
# of the tab order (`walk_visible`, dispatch.jl:184) and is unclickable
# (dispatch.jl:43). A lookup table would reimplement all four.
