# --- DropDownList: the popup's content root ---------------------------

"""
A `DropDown`'s open list: the popup's CONTENT ROOT, its BORDER, and its
click interceptor.

INTERNAL machinery -- the `Scrollpane` `row`/`canvas`/`holder` pattern
(scroll.jl:216) -- with one difference that matters: IT IS NOT IN
`app.root`'s TREE AT ALL. It is what `Popup.content` points at, it is
UNPARENTED, and `open_popup!` throws if it ever stops being.

IT EXISTS FOR EXACTLY ONE REASON, and the reason is two source lines. A
row click must COMMIT, and a `List` click cannot: `_tc_mouse!` calls
`set_cursor!`, which under SINGLE selects AND CONSUMES
(tablecore.jl:1145), and `_walk!` RETURNS THE INSTANT `is_consumed(d)`
(dispatch.jl:88) -- so nothing above the list ever hears about it. This
node sits between the popup's root and the `List` and takes the LEFT
PRESS IN CAPTURE, BEFORE the list can eat it. "Capture belongs to
ancestors that want to intercept" (button.jl:78) -- a `DropDown` is
precisely an interceptor of its own list, and this is the one widget in
the codebase for which that sentence is a specification rather than an
aside.

It earns its keep TWICE: it is also the frame (the border) the list
needs, and the node `popup_opaque!` makes opaque.

`owner` is `Union{Nothing,Widget}` and bound AFTER construction:
`DropDown` holds this and this holds the `DropDown`, and a
self-referential parametric type is not expressible in Julia. ONE
dynamic dispatch per CLICK; NEVER on the frame path.

`list` is CONCRETE (`L<:Widget`), so `_tc_row_at(w.list, e)` dispatches
STATICALLY -- the `Scrollbar{V}`/`Button{F}`/`List{T,F,A}` pattern.

dropdown's list is a scroll, not a choice. A DRAG likewise falls
through. `_tc_row_at` and NOT `row_cursor`: at capture the `List` has
not moved its cursor yet, so `row_cursor` is still the OLD row;
`_tc_row_at` reads the POINTER, over `painted_region`, and is correct
inside a scrolled pane.

"""
A drop-down selection control: a one-row head, and an open list the App
paints OVER the tree through the popup layer.

`panel` is THE popup's content; NOT a child, and absent from
`children(w)` -- so it is not laid out with the tree, not painted with
the tree, and NOT IN THE TAB ORDER. The popup is a paint-and-hit layer,
not a focus layer: the DropDown KEEPS FOCUS while it is open and
forwards, exactly as an HTML `<select>` does.

`selected` is the COMMITTED option and `row_cursor(w.panel.list)` is the
BROWSING position while open -- TWO fields on purpose. ESCAPE and a
click-away abandon the highlight and KEEP the selection; ENTER and a row
click promote the highlight TO the selection. ONE field could not
express "arrowed to Large, pressed ESCAPE, still Medium".

`open` and `selected` are `Dirty.PAINT`-reactive: the arrow is one cell,
and `measure` is `_lst_scan!`'s widest-over-ALL-options plus a constant,
a function of the DATA and not of the selection, so the box does not
jump when you pick a shorter option.
