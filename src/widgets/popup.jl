# popup.jl -- the popup layer: a widget painted OVER the tree.
#
# The spec (2.5) already asks for a layer that renders over the root -- the
# "Increase Terminal Size" overlay -- and the App implements it as
# `app.overlay`, an ordinary widget painted after `app.root` in `frame!`.
# A popup is that same idea made dynamic: instead of one fixed overlay, an
# owner opens a second root (a `DropDown`'s list, a menu, a tooltip) that
# paints over the tree and is hit-tested BEFORE it.
#
# This file holds the framework-neutral half -- the `Popup` value and where
# it lands on screen. The App-facing verbs (`open_popup!`, `close_popup!`,
# `popup_of`, `_popup_dismiss!`) live next to `App`, in popup_ops.jl, so
# they can dispatch on it and reach `frame!`/dispatch.

"""
Where a popup sits relative to the widget that opened it.

`BELOW` and `ABOVE` are fixed; `AUTO` prefers `BELOW` and flips to `ABOVE`
only when the popup would fall off the bottom.

"""
One open popup: a `content` root painted over the tree, the `owner` that
opened it, the `size` the owner declares for it, and a `placement`.

`content` is UNPARENTED -- not in `app.root`'s tree -- which is what lets it
be laid out and painted as a second root without disturbing the first.
`owner` is the widget notified when the popup closes (`on_popup_close!`).
`size` is the owner's declaration, not the content's `measure`: a `List`'s
`measure` returns the whole viewport, so the owner is the only thing that
knows how big its own popup should be.

The on-screen [`Region`](@ref) a popup of `size` occupies when opened off

testable with no App.

`ABOVE` always sits above. `BELOW` and `AUTO` both ANCHOR below and flip
above only when the popup would run off the bottom and there is room above
-- an anchored dropdown wants to open downward but must stay on screen, so
"below" is a preference, not a demand. Either way the result is clamped to
the screen: a list taller than the terminal is not a special case, it is
just clipped.
