"""
One node of a `TreeView`'s data model. NOT A WIDGET.

`List`'s argument (list.jl:14) one type up, and it is worth more here: a
10 000-node tree is 10 000 of THESE and ZERO `WidgetNode`s -- no layout
pass per expand, no 10 000 `render!` dispatches per frame, and -- the
part that is easy to miss -- no 10 000 hit-test nodes, so `hit_test`
stays O(depth) ON EVERY POINTER MOVE, not merely every frame.

NO PARENT POINTER, DELIBERATELY. A `parent` field is a second source of
truth that `push!(n.kids, x)` silently fails to maintain, and building a
tree stops being a literal. `TreeView` recovers the parent FROM THE
FLATTENED ROWS -- the nearest earlier row with a smaller `depth` -- in
O(depth-from-here) on a KEYSTROKE, never on a frame. That is the right
price for a field that cannot go stale because it does not exist.

A scrollable, focusable hierarchical view over `TreeNode` DATA.

`render!` touches `rows[scroll.y+1 : scroll.y+height]` and NOTHING ELSE,
so paint is O(WINDOW), never O(nodes) -- `List`'s contract exactly, and
a 10 000-node tree costs the same frame as a 10-node one.

THE FLATTEN IS O(VISIBLE), NOT O(WINDOW). A fully-expanded 10 000-node
tree holds a 10 000-entry `Vector{TreeRow}`. It is 10 000 `TreeRow`s and
ZERO `WidgetNode`s, which is the claim that matters. A COLLAPSED SUBTREE
CONTRIBUTES EXACTLY ONE ROW HOWEVER DEEP IT IS -- that is not an
optimisation, IT IS WHAT EXPAND/COLLAPSE MEANS.

`flattened` is the memo bit and it is KEYED ON THE SHAPE, NOT ON
`version` -- deliberately: `version` bumps on every ARROW KEY
(`_tc_touch!`), so keying on it would re-flatten 10 000 nodes PER
KEYSTROKE. A cursor move is not a shape change.

GREEDY BY DESIGN: `measure(w, avail) = avail`. `List`'s argument
(list.jl:239) -- an auto-height tree would be as tall as its data and
would NEVER SCROLL AT ALL. Give it `height: 10` or a `grow: 1` parent;
do not put it beside a one-row `Label` you want to survive. This is also
what licenses `version`'s PAINT reactivity: a data change provably
cannot move this box, so `toggle_node!` on a 10 000-node tree costs ZERO
layout.

SINGLE SELECTION ONLY; `mode` IS NOT A KWARG. Re-pinning a `BitSet` of N
rows across a re-flatten has no answer for a selected row whose parent
just collapsed. Under SINGLE the selection IS the cursor and one rule
covers both.
