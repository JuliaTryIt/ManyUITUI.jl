"""
A `Table` plus a SORT: the same data, the same columns, the same paint
loop, viewed through an index PERMUTATION.

WHAT IT ADDS OVER `Table`, EXHAUSTIVELY:

    key::Any                 `key(row, j)` -> something `isless` accepts
    order::Any     view -> source. THE sort.
    rank::Any      source -> view. The inverse.
    sort_col::Int          `0` == source order
    sort_dir::Any
    a sort indicator in the header, and a header click that sorts.

Everything else -- the columns, the sizing, the header, the truncation,
the selection, the navigation, the scrolling, the paint -- is
`tablecore`'s, reached through `_tc_render_table!` and the seam.

WHY TWO TYPES AND NOT ONE WITH A NULLABLE `order`: because `view_source`
is the ONLY behavioural difference, and it is `k` for one and `order[k]`
for the other. One type would branch on a nullable field ONCE PER
VISIBLE ROW PER FRAME, forever, on every table in every app, to serve
the ones that never sort. Two types make the compiler take that branch
ONCE, at specialisation time, and a `Table` that never sorts pays
neither the branch nor the 2n `Int`s -- 1.6 MB on 100 000 rows -- that
`order` and `rank` cost. That is not a new argument in this codebase, it
is the house one (label.jl:98, `Scrollbar{V}`).

TWO CALLBACKS, `cell` AND `key`, and the separation is the whole point:

    cell(row, j)::AbstractString  -- what the user SEES
    key(row, j)                   -- what the sort COMPARES

Sorting a numeric column by its RENDERED string puts "10" before "9".
That is a bug in every table library that conflates the two.

`key` IS A REQUIRED KEYWORD. It has NO default, and in particular it
does NOT default to `cell`. A default that silently does the wrong thing
is an honest confession of a dishonest default; a `sort_by!` that
silently no-ops is a quiet nothing on the one call whose entire purpose
is to change something. A required keyword makes the decision
UNAVOIDABLE AT CONSTRUCTION and unmissable in review. A `DataTable`
exists to sort; one without a sort key is a `Table`.

`key(row, j)` must return values mutually `isless`-comparable WITHIN a
column. Across columns it may return anything: the sort closes over a
FIXED `j`, so every comparison in a given `sort_by!` is homogeneous. A
column of MIXED types THROWS a `MethodError` from `isless` -- it is not
"merely slow".

THE ORDER, PRECISELY: the view order OR the sorted column OR the
direction -- "something actually changed", which is the convention every
mutator in this family follows (`set_scroll!`, widget.jl:204). The three
are ONE fact and the wider reading is the load-bearing one: a column
whose keys are ALL EQUAL flips ASCENDING to DESCENDING without moving a
single row, and a `false` there would skip the PAINT bump and leave the
header showing an arrow that contradicts `sort_direction(w)`. The
indicator is state, not order.

THROWS `ArgumentError` when `1 <= j <= ncols` and `!cols[j].sortable`,
and `BoundsError` on a `j` outside `0:ncols`. It does NOT silently
no-op: a quiet nothing on the one call whose whole purpose is to change
something is the worst available failure.

DOES NOT MUTATE THE CALLER'S DATA, and the mechanism IS the whole
answer: `sortperm` READS `rows` and returns a PERMUTATION. `rows` is
never touched, never permuted, never copied. Sorting a COPY costs O(n)
memory and O(n) moves of `R` and severs identity; sorting IN PLACE
mutates a `Vector` the caller handed us and may still be using. The
permutation costs 8n bytes, moves `Int`s, and `view_source`'s one array
load is the entire read side.

THE ALGORITHM IS SPELLED, NOT DEFAULTED:

    ks = [w.key(w.rows[i], j) for i in 1:n]
    p  = sortperm(ks; alg = MergeSort, rev = (dir === DESCENDING))

  * MATERIALIZING `ks` FIRST IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION, IT IS THE
    ALGORITHM. `sort!(order; by = i -> key(rows[i], j))` runs `by` TWICE
    PER COMPARISON, because `Base.Order.By` has no Schwartzian
    transform. MEASURED: 17824 `by` calls at n=2000 versus 2000 for this
    spelling -- ~9x. The comprehension also INFERS its eltype, so a
    numeric column sorts a concrete `Vector{Float64}`.
  * `alg = MergeSort` IS SPELLED even though `sortperm`'s default is
    already stable. Stability is a CONTRACT here, and a contract you get
    from a default is a contract you will lose.
  * `rev = true` REVERSES THE ORDERING, NOT THE OUTPUT, so ties keep
    their SOURCE order in BOTH directions:
    `sortperm([2,1,2,1,2]; rev=true, alg=MergeSort) == [1,3,5,2,4]`,
    NOT `[5,3,1,4,2]`. That is what "stable" has to mean for a user who
    sorts by Department then by Name and expects the Names still in
    order within a Department.
  * `order` is RESET to `1:n` before every sort, so `sort_by!(w, 2,
    ASCENDING)` gives the same answer whatever the history. THE PRICE:
    no multi-key sort by chaining. That feature is not lost, it is
    RELOCATED to where it costs nothing -- `key = (r, j) -> (r.dept,
    r.name)` IS the multi-key sort, it is one line of user code, and
    unlike chaining it says what it means.

THE SELECTION DOES NOT MOVE, AND THERE IS NO CODE HERE THAT MOVES IT.
`Selection` stores SOURCE indices, so a sort -- a claim about ORDER --
cannot touch a selection -- a claim about ROWS. That is the entire
reason the index space is source-based, and it is why this function has
no `remap!` to get wrong. The cursor does not change ROW; it changes
SCREEN POSITION, because `view_rank` changed. `_tc_follow_cursor!` then
runs, so THE USER'S ROW STAYS UNDER THEIR EYES across the sort.

THE COLUMN WIDTHS DO NOT CHANGE: `_tc_auto!` samples SOURCE rows
`1:sample`, never view rows, so a width that moved under a sort is
impossible by construction.

O(n) key materialisation + O(n log n) sortperm + O(n) `_dt_rank!`. ALL
OF IT ON A USER ACTION, once per header click. The frame path is
untouched.

seed, so a reset that stopped there would collapse every AUTO column to
its own caption: re-speccing ONE column's alignment would silently
resize its NEIGHBOURS. A column model rewritten is a column model
measured, and the cost is the construction cost -- O(min(sample, n) x
AUTO columns), bounded, on an explicit call and never on a frame.
