# widgets/table.jl -- layer 7.
# May reference: widget, reactive, paint, buffer, layout, unicode, and
# `RowsWidget`/`Selection`/`Column`/`TableGrid`, which
# widgets/tablecore.jl DEFINES and this file USES and MUST NOT redefine.
#
# This file is THIN and contains NO PAINT LOOP: `_tc_render_table!` is
# generic over `W<:RowsWidget` and lives in `tablecore.jl`, so
# `datatable.jl` does not depend on this file for anything.
#
# THE HEADER DOES NOT SCROLL VERTICALLY BUT DOES FOLLOW THE COLUMNS
# HORIZONTALLY. That asymmetry is the whole point of a table header --
# get it wrong and the header lies about which column you are looking at
# -- and it is not a mechanism here, it is the ABSENCE of one: the
# painter reads `xs[j] - off.x` for the header AND the body, and reads
# `off.y` for the body ALONE. One arithmetic, two `y` rules, in
# `_tc_render_table!`.
#
# A ROW IS NOT A WIDGET: 100 000 rows are 100 000 elements of a `Vector`
# and ZERO `WidgetNode`s. `content_extent` is overridden and O(1), and
# `render!` is O(visible rows x VISIBLE columns), so a 100 000 x 500
# table costs the same frame as a 20 x 6 one.
#
# `Base.textwidth` appears NOWHERE. No byte indexes user text.

"""
Columns with headers over a `Vector` of rows.

`Table` OWNS its rows. A view that owns nothing cannot answer
`_tc_sync!`, cannot `reindex_*` its selection, and forces a SECOND data
model across `Table`/`DataTable` -- which is a second paint loop or a
messier seam. One data model, one paint loop, and `view_source` is the
only delta between the two widgets. A caller with a lazy source
materialises a window into a `Vector` themselves.

THE CELL CALLBACK IS ON THE WIDGET, NOT ON THE COLUMN, and this is the
decisive type decision of the tier. A `Vector{Column{T,G}}` parametric
on the projection is IMPOSSIBLE -- each column's closure has its own
type, so one `G` cannot serve them all -- which forces `Column` to hold
an ABSTRACT projection field and pay ONE DYNAMIC DISPATCH PER VISIBLE
CELL, FOREVER. `cell::Any` on the widget is one CONCRETE type parameter, a
STATIC dispatch, the same expressive power (`cell(row, j)` can branch on
`j` however it likes), and it is the `Button{F}` pattern this package
already uses three times.

`rows` is a PLAIN field, ALIASED, not a `Reactive` -- `List`'s reason,
`List`'s price, `List`'s `render!`-time self-heal via `_tc_sync!`.

`version` is `Dirty.PAINT`-reactive -- `List`'s reason, verbatim.

`cell(row, j)` MUST return an `AbstractString`, MUST be PURE and CHEAP,
and MUST NOT contain a newline. It is called ONCE PER VISIBLE CELL PER
FRAME -- never for a culled column, never for a row outside the window,
and never during `_tc_auto!` for a non-AUTO column.
