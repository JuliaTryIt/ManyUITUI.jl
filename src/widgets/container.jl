A bare grouping widget: no content of its own, all behaviour from its
`BoxStyle` and its children.

"""
An empty container.

It defines neither `measure` nor `render!`, and that is the point: the
defaults -- the union of the children's outer measures, and a no-op
paint -- are already exactly right for a widget whose whole job is to
hold other widgets. Direction, gap, padding, border and background all
come from its `BoxStyle`, which is the cascade's business.
