`box` as exactly the value an empty cascade would compute makes the two

A pane scrolling `child`, or an empty one.

  * `shrink = 0f0` on the HOLDER is what creates the overflow. The
    default `shrink` is `1f0`, so without it the flex kernel absorbs the
    overflow and squeezes the content down to the window -- an 8-row
    document in a 3-row window collapses to 3 rows and there is nothing
    left to scroll.
  * `align = Align.START` on the canvas is what stops the holder's WIDTH
    being stretched to the window. `Align.STRETCH`, the default, would
    pin the content's width to the window's and horizontal scrolling
    could never happen at all.

The canvas is the WINDOW and the holder is the CONTENT, deliberately two
nodes: one box cannot be both 3 rows tall (what you see) and 8 rows tall
(what there is), and the scrollable seam reads the first from
`layout_of(canvas).content` and the second from `content_extent(canvas)`.

Re-clamp the stored offset to the CURRENT geometry, as the pane paints.

Layout can move under a scroll offset that was legal when it was stored:
grow the terminal until the content fits and an offset of 5 becomes an
offset past the end, painting blank rows under content that would now fit
whole. Nothing else can catch it -- `handle!(app, ::Any)`
relayouts WITHOUT dispatching the event to the tree, so no `on_event!`
method ever sees a resize.

`paint!` is PRE-ORDER, so this runs before the canvas and its subtree
paint and the correction lands in the SAME frame. It converges: once in
range `set_scroll!` is a no-op that marks nothing, and `mark!` never
wakes the app, so marking `PAINT` mid-paint cannot loop.

THE PRICE, measured rather than asserted: 208 B/frame/pane, all of it
the dynamic dispatch `content_extent` pays walking the canvas's
`Vector{Widget}` -- the same dispatch `paint!` itself pays per node. For
scale, a 149-node frame allocates 44672 B, so a pane costs ~0.5% of one.
