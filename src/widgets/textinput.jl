# widgets/textinput.jl -- layer 7.
# May reference: widget, reactive, paint, buffer, layout, unicode.
#
# This file also DEFINES the shared grapheme helpers that `textarea.jl`
# uses. They live here rather than in `widget.jl` because layer 4 may not
# reference `unicode.jl`; the include order guarantees `textarea.jl` sees
# them, and keeps ONE definition of each.
#
# NORMATIVE grapheme discipline for this file and `textarea.jl`:
#
#   1. A cursor steps by GRAPHEME CLUSTER -- never a codepoint, never a
#      byte. One `move_by!(w, 1)` crosses exactly one cluster however
#      many codepoints or cells it is.
#   2. A wide cluster is ONE step and TWO cells. The index counts
#      clusters; the column is DERIVED via `text_width` of the prefix.
#   3. `Base.textwidth` is FORBIDDEN on a string or a char. It sums
#      codepoints and ignores clustering: `textwidth("👨‍👩‍👧") == 6`,
#      `textwidth("❤️") == 1`. Use `grapheme_width` / `text_width`.
#   4. Byte indexing into user text is FORBIDDEN except through the
#      helpers below, which are the one place byte and cluster indices
#      are allowed to meet.
#   5. The cursor is 0-based, `0:n`: a COUNT of clusters before the
#      caret, not a coordinate. The package's 1-based rule governs
#      `Region`, `Buffer` and `MouseEvent`, none of which this is.
#   6. On insert the caret is RECOMPUTED from the new prefix, never
#      advanced by the inserted cluster count -- a combining mark MERGES
#      into the preceding cluster and the count may not increase at all.
#   7. A wide cluster that would straddle an edge is dropped WHOLE, at
#      the LEFT edge as well as the right.

Single-line text entry.

`text` and `cursor` are `Dirty.PAINT`-reactive, and that is a design
commitment rather than an optimisation: `measure` returns
`Size(avail.width, 1)`, so a `TextInput` NEVER resizes to its content --
that is what the horizontal scroll is for. A keystroke provably cannot
move a single box, so a keystroke costs ZERO layout.

`Reactive`'s default is the conservative `Dirty.LAYOUT` precisely
because choosing PAINT for state that can change size is a correctness
bug. The text-independent `measure` above is what licenses PAINT here;
do not copy the choice to a widget without that property.

The horizontal scroll lives in `node(w).scroll.x`. The core never
applies it (a `TextInput` has no children) -- `render!` reads it and
slices. Storing it there anyway is what lets a `Scrollbar` observe a
`TextInput` with no new code.
