E2. The minimal diff. PURE: mutates NEITHER argument.

Rows are scanned stride-1. Runs of changed cells coalesce into `Span`s;
two runs separated by `<= gap` unchanged cells MERGE, because a CUP
costs about six bytes and a re-emitted cell costs about one. The
default of 4 is the measured break-even.

S3: a changed cell that is a `CELL_CONT` pulls its width-2 head into
the span (walk left to the head first), and a changed width-2 head
pulls its `CELL_CONT` in. A `Span` therefore NEVER begins or ends
mid-grapheme, so the escape stream can never place the cursor inside a
wide glyph.

`size(old) != size(new)` yields `Patch(spans covering all of new,
size(new), true)`.
