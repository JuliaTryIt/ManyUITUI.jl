# driver.jl -- layer 4. May reference: types, geometry, color, events.
# U3: THE contract that makes ManyUIWeb possible. NINE methods.
#
# NORMATIVE NEGATIVE INVARIANT: no method in REQUIRED_DRIVER_METHODS
# accepts or returns a Buffer, BufferView, Patch, Span, Widget, Region,
# LayoutBox, LayoutMap, Style or Cell. A driver moves bytes, reports a
# size and capabilities, and yields events. If ManyUIWeb ever needs a
# tenth method, the abstraction has leaked and the fix is to reshape the
# seam -- not to reach inside. This invariant is a @testitem, not a
# comment.
