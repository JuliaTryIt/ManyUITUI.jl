# dispatch_tests.jl -- @testitem blocks for ManyUI/src/dispatch.jl.

# E3 / EARS 2.2: "When a user input event (keyboard stroke, mouse click,
# or scroll) occurs, the ManyUI framework shall propagate the event
# through the component tree using capture and bubble phases until the
# event is consumed."
#
# events_tests.jl proves the ENVELOPE (Dispatch/Phase/consume!) can
# express such a walk on a bare node chain. What is proved here is that
# `propagate!` performs that walk on a REAL tree, that `dispatch_event!`
# routes each event class to the right target, and that consumption
# truncates the walk at every phase.
