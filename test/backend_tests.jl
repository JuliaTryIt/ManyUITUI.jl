# backend_tests.jl -- the Backend seam and `launch`.
#
# The point of `launch` is that ONE call runs an app on any target, so the
# tests that matter are the ones that pin the parts a user would otherwise
# have to change by hand: who calls the factory, how many times, what the
# handle protocol is, and whether an out-of-tree Backend can join without
# touching ManyUITUI. ManyUIWeb's WebBackend is exactly such an out-of-tree
# backend, so the custom-backend testitem below is the standing proof that
# it can exist.
