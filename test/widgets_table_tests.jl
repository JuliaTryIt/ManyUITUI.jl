# widgets_table_tests.jl -- Table: columns, headers, and the column
# sizing kernel (layer 7).
#
# Every testitem is self-contained, starts `using ManyUI`, needs no tty
# and never sleeps.
#
# THE TWO THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO PIN DOWN:
#
#   1. A ROW IS DATA, NOT A WIDGET. `render!` is O(visible rows x
#      VISIBLE columns) and `content_extent` is O(1), so a 100 000 x 500
#      table costs the same frame as a 20 x 6 one. Every scale test here
#      is a deterministic COUNT of `cell` calls -- never a timing test,
#      and therefore unfoolable.
#   2. THE HEADER DOES NOT SCROLL VERTICALLY BUT DOES FOLLOW THE COLUMNS
#      HORIZONTALLY. That asymmetry is the whole point of a table
#      header: get it wrong and the header lies about which column you
#      are looking at.
#
# `Base.textwidth` appears nowhere. A wide cluster is ONE step and TWO
# cells, and it is never halved -- not at a column edge, not at a frame
# edge.
